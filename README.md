# Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Heya! I'm Thibaut, also known as Ghast. I'm a 'programmer' but mostly a tech enthuisiast. My current interest lies in cryptography, algorithms, mathematics and product distribution. 
I also like concurrency. I will do anything to escape using Python. I did some memes in the past.

To contact me, refer to either to my discord (Ghast#0001) or my regular contact email (support@ghast.cc)
